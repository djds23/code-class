# Exercise 1

#### Math

Find the following values:

* If the bill is $100, what is the tip for 10%, 12%, 15% and 20%?

# Exercise 2

#### Variables

Store your first and last name in 2 different variables. Then add them together

```python
>>> first_name = 'Steve'
>>> last_name = 'Harwell'
>>> first + last
```

Why is there no space in between them? Can we add one? 


# Exercise 3

#### Try multiplying...

```python
>>> 10 * 3
```

and

```python
>>> 10 * "3"
```

What is different about the output? why do they look different?
