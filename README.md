#### Personal Laptop Policy

If you choose to use your personal laptop, feel free to! The class will contain no production data.

That being said, I would like to issue a reminder that you should *NEVER* put proietary company data on your personal laptop. IT works very hard to keep our data safe and secure on company equipment, and having this data on a personal laptop is a threat to the entire organization.
